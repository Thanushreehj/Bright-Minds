# Bright‑Minds

A frontend-only, responsive educational website designed to support children (ages 6–10) with learning differences—such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, or slow cognitive development—through clear, colorful, and engaging learning pages.

> This prototype focuses exclusively on the UI/UX and interactive lessons.

-- Purpose
To prototype an inclusive learning environment that shows how accessible content can be structured, with:
- Modular subjects like Math, English, and General Knowledge
- A supportive parents’ resources section
- Attention to simplicity, clarity, and responsiveness for young users
