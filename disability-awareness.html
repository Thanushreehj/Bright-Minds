            <img src="autism.jpeg" alt="Illustration of autism spectrum awareness">
            <p><strong>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)</strong> are a diverse group of conditions. They are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviors, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details, and unusual reactions to sensations.</p>
            
            <p>The abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others have severe disabilities and require life-long care and support.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Epidemiology:</strong> It is estimated that worldwide about 1 in 100 children has autism. The prevalence varies substantially across studies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Causes:</strong> Available scientific evidence suggests that there are many factors, including environmental and genetic factors, that make a child more likely to have autism.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Assessment and Care:</strong> A broad range of interventions from early childhood and across the lifespan can optimize the development, health, well-being, and quality of life of autistic people.</p>

            <p><strong>Inattention:</strong> Trouble staying on task, paying attention, or being organized.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> Extreme restlessness or constant movement, fidgeting, or excessive talking.</p>

            <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> ADHD is often managed with a combination of medication, psychotherapy, and other behavioral interventions.</p>
